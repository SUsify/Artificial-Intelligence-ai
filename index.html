                <p> Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence exhibited by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence exhibited by animals, including humans. Major AI textbooks define this area as "intelligent agent" research. In other words, it is a system that senses the environment and takes actions that maximize the chances of achieving a goal. Some popular reports use the term "artificial intelligence" to describe machinest mimic the "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving." .. However, this definition has been rejected by good AI researchers.
                    AI applications include advanced web search engines (such as Google), recommender systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, Netflix), human language understanding (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (such as Tesla), and automated. The highest level of strategic game systems (such as chess and go) that include decision making and competition. </p>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="history-of-ai.png">
                <p style="font-size: 20px"><b style="color: darkgoldenrod">Maturation of Artificial Intelligence (1943-1952)</b><br><br>
                    Year 1943: The first work which is now recognized as AI was done by Warren McCulloch and Walter pits in 1943. They proposed a model of artificial neurons.<br><br>
                    Year 1949: Donald Hebb demonstrated an updating rule for modifying the connection strength between neurons. His rule is now called Hebbian learning.<br><br>
                    Year 1950: The Alan Turing who was an English mathematician and pioneered Machine learning in 1950. Alan Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" in which he proposed a test. The test can check the machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to human intelligence, called a Turing test.<br><br>
                    <b style="color: darkgoldenrod"> The birth of Artificial Intelligence (1952-1956)</b><br><br>
                    Year 1955: An Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon created the "first artificial intelligence program"Which was named as "Logic Theorist". This program had proved 38 of 52 Mathematics theorems, and find new and more elegant proofs for some theorems.<br><br>
                    Year 1956: The word "Artificial Intelligence" first adopted by American Computer scientist John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference. For the first time, AI coined as an academic field.<br><br>
                    At that time high-level computer languages such as FORTRAN, LISP, or COBOL were invented. And the enthusiasm for AI was very high at that time.<br><br>

                    <b style="color: darkgoldenrod">The golden years-Early enthusiasm (1956-1974)</b><br><br>
                    Year 1966: The researchers emphasized developing algorithms which can solve mathematical problems. Joseph Weizenbaum created the first chatbot in 1966, which was named as ELIZA.<br><br>
                    Year 1972: The first intelligent humanoid robot was built in Japan which was named as WABOT-1.<br><br>
                    <b style="color: darkgoldenrod"> The first AI winter (1974-1980)</b><br><br>
                    The duration between years 1974 to 1980 was the first AI winter duration. AI winter refers to the time period where computer scientist dealt with a severe shortage of funding from government for AI researches.<br><br>
                    During AI winters, an interest of publicity on artificial intelligence was decreased.<br><br>
                    <b style="color: darkgoldenrod">A boom of AI (1980-1987)</b><br><br>
                    Year 1980: After AI winter duration, AI came back with "Expert System". Expert systems were programmed that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert.<br><br>
                    In the Year 1980, the first national conference of the American Association of Artificial Intelligence was held at Stanford University.<br><br>
                    <b style="color: darkgoldenrod">The second AI winter (1987-1993)</b><br><br>
                    The duration between the years 1987 to 1993 was the second AI Winter duration.<br><br>
                    Again Investors and government stopped in funding for AI research as due to high cost but not efficient result. The expert system such as XCON was very cost effective.<br><br>
                    <b style="color: darkgoldenrod">The emergence of intelligent agents (1993-2011)</b><br><br>
                    Year 1997: In the year 1997, IBM Deep Blue beats world chess champion, Gary Kasparov, and became the first computer to beat a world chess champion.<br><br>
                    Year 2002: for the first time, AI entered the home in the form of Roomba, a vacuum cleaner.<br><br>
                    Year 2006: AI came in the Business world till the year 2006. Companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix also started using AI.<br><br>
                    <b style="color: darkgoldenrod"> Deep learning, big data and artificial general intelligence (2011-present)</b><br><br>
                    Year 2011: In the year 2011, IBM's Watson won jeopardy, a quiz show, where it had to solve the complex questions as well as riddles. Watson had proved that it could understand natural language and can solve tricky questions quickly.<br><br>
                    Year 2012: Google has launched an Android app feature "Google now", which was able to provide information to the user as a prediction.<br><br>
                    Year 2014: In the year 2014, Chatbot "Eugene Goostman" won a competition in the infamous "Turing test."<br><br>
                    Year 2018: The "Project Debater" from IBM debated on complex topics with two master debaters and also performed extremely well.
                    Google has demonstrated an AI program "Duplex" which was a virtual assistant and which had taken hairdresser appointment on call, and lady on other side didn't notice that she was talking with the machine.

            <h1>AI Usage</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">When most people think about artificial intelligence (A.I.), they think of machines learning how to think like humans in sci-fi movies such as Star Wars and Terminator. A.I. and machine learning may seem like an imaginative, futuristic notion, but in reality, there’s a wide variety of current technological developments that utilize A.I.–all of which empower us and help us go about our daily responsibilities. Here’s a list of 11 neat examples of artificial intelligence that have a role in our everyday lives.<br><br></p>
            <h2>Navigation Apps</h2><img class="img-responsive"src="613a4c26745e9027886526e9_open-graph(navigation).jpeg" height="500">
            <p style="font-size: 20px">Believe it or not, even your daily commute to and from work requires the utilization of AI . Navigation apps like Google Maps use A.I. to research the speed of movement of traffic. It also takes in user-reported incidents, like traffic accidents or construction , to predict how long it'll take you to succeed in your destination and uses that information to suggest the fastest route.

            </p>
            <h2>Rideshare Apps</h2><img class="img-responsive" src="1_vnzrUYjvSasgINqUEueG1w.jpeg" height="500">
            <p>Now suppose rather than driving yourself to figure , you select to require an Uber to your office. How do rideshare apps determine the worth of your ride or the wait time once you call an Uber? the solution is machine learning, another example of AI . consistent with Uber’s Head of Machine Learning Danny Lange, a rider’s wait time is “based on data from many trips, which lets uber take into consideration normal patterns that occur day after day.”


            </p>
            <h2>Short Videos and Video Summaries</h2><img class="img-responsive" src="maxresdefault.jpg" height="500">
            <p>Popularized by Netflix, short summary videos are quimg-responsiveickly replacing static video thumbnails in streaming apps and on websites. Instead of requiring someone to watch and summarize the thousands of hours of content on a streaming serve, they make us of AI to automatically understand the content of the video and create a short video summary.
                <br><br>
                This technology is also being used to automatically create highlight reels and other compilations.
            </p>
            <h2> 3D Photography</h2><img class="img-responsive" src="3d_pixabay_1200x768.webp" height="500">
            <p>3D photography has become a powerful thanks to capture and display photos. The LucidPix app, for instance , allows you to capture 3D Photos or convert 2D photos to 3D without the necessity for multiple cameras. The advanced AI behind LucidPix is in a position to infer which parts of your photo have higher levels of depth compared to other parts of your photo. Then, with a click of a button, LucidPix adds depth to your photos and turns them into lifelike 3D images.

            </p>
            <h2>Facial Recognition</h2><img class="img-responsive" src="facial-recognition-feature_1200x675_hero_090418.jpg" height="500">
            <p>3D photography has become a powerful thanks to capture and display photos. The LucidPix app, for instance , allows you to capture 3D Photos or convert 2D photos to 3D without the necessity for multiple cameras. The advanced AI behind LucidPix is in a position to infer which parts of your photo have higher levels of depth compared to other parts of your Apps like LucidPix, Snapchat, and Facebook have all utilized A.I. in its face recognition technology. LucidPix uses face recognition to detect a user’s face for the “3D Face” feature, which allows users to capture and convert their selfies to 3D photos. Similarly, Snapchat uses A.I. to acknowledge users’ faces and apply face filters to users’ photos. In Facebook, face recognition is employed to spot faces in photos and invite users to tag themselves or their Facebook friends.

            <h1>Levels Of AI</h1>
            <p style="font-size:20">AI is divided broadly into three stages: artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial super intelligence (ASI).</p>
            <h2>Artificial Narrow Intelligence(ANI)</h2><img class="img-responsive" src="ai20-jpg.jpeg" height="250">
            <p style="font-size:20">It is also called Weak AI.Weak artificial intelligence (weak AI) is artificial intelligence that implements a limited part of mind, or, as narrow AI, is focused on one narrow task. In John Searle's terms it “would be useful for testing hypotheses about minds, but would not actually be minds”.Some commentators who think weak AI could be dangerous because of this "brittleness" and fail in unpredictable ways. Weak AI could cause disruptions in the electric grid, damage nuclear power plants, cause global economic problems, and misdirect autonomous vehicles.Siri and Alexa could be considered weak AI, but generally, they are weak AI programs.</p>
            <h2>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</h2><img class="img-responsive" src="download%20(1).jfif" height="250">
            <p style="font-size: 20px"> Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the hypothetical ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can.It is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and a common topic in science fiction and futures studies. AGI can also be referred to as strong AI, full AI, or general intelligent action . This is a concept of the machine with general intelligence that mimics human intelligence, with the ability to think, understand, learn and apply its intelligence to solve any problem as humans do in any given situation.          </p>   
            <h2>Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)</h2><img class="img-responsive" src="maxresdefault%20(1).jpg" height="250">
            <p style="font-size: 20">Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) is a software-based system with intellectual powers beyond those of humans across an almost comprehensive range of categories and fields of endeavor.ASI would have a greater memory with a faster ability to process and analyze situations, data, and stimuli actions. Due to this fact, we can rest assured that the decision-making and problem-solving capabilities of super-intelligent beings/machines would be far superior and precise as compared to those of human beings.</p>
